# Hey there ðŸ‘‹, Im Zane (AKA CypherX)
##  A bit about me:
Intrigued by the gaming and technological sectors since high school, I embarked on a dynamic journey that spans nine years of diverse experiences in the gaming industry. From starting a high school game development course to specializing in 2D Platform development, graphic design, community management, and quality assurance, my path has been marked by a commitment to innovation.

Beyond gaming, my professional canvas extends to the Maker Community, where I've honed skills in machine operation, 3D modeling, VR technologies, web development, and more. Proficient in operating a spectrum of machinery, including 3D printers and CNC machines, I thrive on implementing custom systems for operational efficiency.

In leadership roles, I've orchestrated successful marketing strategies, managed social media outreach, and coordinated impactful collaborative projects across diverse sectors. My academic pursuits in Computer Science and Cyber Security, complemented by a Graphic Design background (ASA 2017), underscore my dedication to a multifaceted skill set.

In essence, I am a seasoned industry professional weaving technical proficiency with a strategic mindset. As I look forward, my journey continues to be defined by a passion for innovation, collaborative leadership, and pursuit of excellence in the ever-evolving landscape of gaming and technology.
